In the year 2070, the world nations are united through a council that is headed by a World Leader.
The World Leader is annually re-elected, allowing for diverse representation with the goal
of maintaining peace

This union was started from the increasing need for all nations to work together to combat the rapid
deterioration of the planet as nations continued to grow and exploit more natural resources. Rivers
are beginning to dry up, little fresh water is left underground, rampant disease kills many, and many
other ill effects are common. Without the union, most nations would have already been left desolate.

At first appearance, this institution seems effectiveâ€”the nations seem to help each other through
natural disasters and economic crises.

However, there is a subversive group within the world council that are fighting for superiority of
their nation. This group consists of hackers and spies who use their position to glean vital
information from the other nations, along with denying the same information to those nations.

The union is working together to build a spaceship that will be able to support the life of
many people for a thousand years. These spaceships will be used to leave the planet for long enough
to let it naturally clean itself up enough to once again sustain life. But the subversive group is
working to steal this information for themselves, so that they will be able to leave the planet
and leave the rest of the nations on a dying planet.

It is also your job to discover who is part of the subversive group, and prevent them from
obtaining all the necessary information for their plan.
