Notes about Global Crisis:
==========================
This game is designed pretty much entirely around player discussions. Players should be working together
to discover who the Traitors are while managing the three resources: World Health, Money, and Stolen
Technology. Everything is about secrecy and convincing everyone of who you are, or convincing everyone
that you are not a Traitor even if you are. There hasn't been much time to balance everything, so it
could be in a relatively rough state, but even so, the base gameplay is quite fun. You can even
create your own permutations on the game in order to have things be a bit more balanced for your own
group of friends.

Notes about events:
===================
All events are written in the following format:
```

These events can be put into cards and put into a deck that is randomly shuffled and pulled
from every turn.
